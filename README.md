# JavaScript Game Development Course for Beginners

Use HTML, CSS and JS to develop 9 separate game development projects.

## Description

> Learn to make 2D games with HTML, CSS & plain vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks and no libraries! From sprite animation to state management, in this series of projects you will learn everything you need to make your own 2D animated games! We will go step by step explaining each technique on a small standalone codebase and then we will use everything we learned to make a single final game.

Offered by [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) & [Frank's Laboratory](https://www.youtube.com/c/Frankslaboratory), this is my execution of the free 10 hour course.
